# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a=16
print(bin(a))
```

## Output
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (66)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6dd0d3d-1664-42e3-9fb9-824d8f4f8404" />

## Result
Thus, the Python program that converts the number 16 into its binary representation using a built-in function has been executed successfully.
